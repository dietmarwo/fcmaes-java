== Performance

=== Engineering Design Optimization Performance

In this domain we often have multiple competing objectives and a lot of constraints. We present results for the
http://ladse.eng.isas.jaxa.jp/benchmark/[Mazda real-world car structure design benchmark], the simultaneous
optimization of three car models minimizing their weight, increasing the number of shared thicknesses of structural  
parts thereby fulfilling 54 constraints. 2017 there was a competition related to this problem https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/tjpnsec/9/2/9_86/_article/-char/en[Report of Evolutionary Computation Competition 2017],
but until now not many of the ideas produced there have found their way into open source optimization libraries. 

We applied https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java/blob/master/src/main/java/fcmaes/core/MoDe.java[MoDe.java] for 
about 1 hour runtime using one AMD 5950x CPU on Linux, de/rand/1 strategy (nsga_update=False, pareto_update=False), 
population size = 512. We choose the best run out of two executed in parallel, each utilizing 16 threads (workers=16). 
This way about 8200 function evaluations are performed per second for both runs combined.  

The resulting pareto front with hypervolume 0.3844 is:

The "reference" NSGA-II solution given as part of the benchmark has hypervolume 0.1456:

Note, that the reference solution was computed using a limited budget. But NSGA-II scales much worse than fcmaes-MoDe
using https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/tjpnsec/11/2/11_18/_article/-char/en/[enhanced multiple constraint ranking].

=== Space Flight Trajectory Planning Optimization Challenge

fcmaes-java provides fast parallel
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java/blob/master/src/main/java/fcmaes/examples[example solvers] for the 
real world space flight design problems https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/gtop[GTOP] and for 
the https://mintoc.de/index.php/F-8_aircraft[F-8_aircraft] problem based on differential equations. 
On http://www.midaco-solver.com/index.php/about/benchmarks/gtopx[GTOPX] you can find implementations 
of the corresponding objective functions using different programming languages.

The challenge is now to solve these problems on a modern many-core CPU faster than the  
given https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java/blob/master/src/main/java/fcmaes/examples[examples].
If an optimizer needs multiple retries, take the average amount of time
for all retries until the problem is solved. The solution times given in the tables 
below are for Linux / AMD 5950x CPU.

Note that 'stopVal' is the value determining success and
'mean time' includes the time for failed runs.
Execute 
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java/blob/master/src/main/java/fcmaes/examples/TestGtop.java[TestGtop.java]
to reproduce these results. The same optimization algorithm
was applied for all problems, using the same parameters both for the 
optimization algorithm and the coordinated retry. In theory it should be possible to 
design a superior algorithm specifically optimized for a given task.

One improvement idea is to replace the DE algorithm used by 
https://esa.github.io/pagmo2/docs/cpp/algorithms/de1220.html[pg.de1220],
the excellent differential evolution variant from pagmo2. 
This improves the tandem result preserving the others:

=== ESAs Messenger-Full Space Trajectory Design Problem

Because of its famous complexity ESAs 26-dimensional https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/gtop/messenger_full/[Messenger full] 
problem is often referenced in the literature, see for instance http://www.midaco-solver.com/data/pub/PDPTA20_Messenger.pdf[MXHCP paper].

fcmaes is the only library capable of solving it using a single CPU: 
In about 1250 seconds on average using an AMD 5950x (1950 seconds for the 
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es[python] variant).

The Problem models a multi-gravity assist interplanetary space mission from Earth to Mercury. In 2009 the first good solution (6.9 km/s)
was submitted. It took more than five years to reach 1.959 km/s and three more years until 2017 to find the optimum 1.958 km/s. 
The picture below shows the progress of the whole science community since 2009:

image::Fsc.png[]  

102 runs of the coordinated parallel retry were performed on a single AMD 5950x CPU 
using the DE->CMA sequence as optimization algorithm: 

image::DE-CMA_AMD_5950x.png[]

60 of the 102 runs reached a good result below 2 km/s:

image::DE-CMA_AMD_5950x.2.png[]  

About 1.7*10^6 function evaluations per second were performed which shows excellent scaling of the algorithm utilizing all
16 cores / 32 threads.
