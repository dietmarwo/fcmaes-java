/**
 * Class that implements random number generation. The default implementation
 * includes a relatively fast pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) using a
 * classic formula "seed = ( a * seed + c ) % m" (LCG). This implementation
 * uses bits 32-61 (30 bits) of the state variable which ensures at least 2^32
 * period in the lowest significant bit of the resulting pseudo-random
 * sequence. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator
 * for more details.
