== Solar Orbiter

In 2020 ESA created a pykep pull request defining a new optimization model for the Solar Orbiter mission
https://github.com/esa/pykep/pull/127[(PR127)]. The original solar orbiter mission aimed at high inclination 
relative to the solar equator and low perhelion to investigate the solar poles from a low distance
https://issues.cosmos.esa.int/solarorbiterwiki/download/attachments/44993822/SOL-ESC-RP-05500%20-%20Issue%205r0%2C%20201681029%20-%20Solar%20Orbiter%20CReMA%20Issue%205%20Rev%200.pdf[(SolarOrbiter)] 
The mission used mostly ballistic transfers. After some transfers between 
Earth and Venus a number of Venus resonance transfers were used to reach these goals utilizing gravity assist
maneuvers at the planets.  
Originally a deterministic search algorithm was applied. Reformulation as an optimization problem
can serve several purposes:

- Avoid "bias". May be different planet sequences / resonances / flight heights at the gravity assists 
lead to better solutions

- Verification: Find out if the pruning of the deterministic search space was correct or if there are 
good solutions missed there.  

- Performance: May be optimization is faster than deterministic search?

- Balance between multiple objectives and the constraints: With a optimization model it may be easier to experiment 
with a different balancing between objectives and constraints.  

In 2008 an optimization model for the Messenger mission was created which could "reproduce" the required 
resonances. It took some years until 2021 an optimization algorithm was found reducing the solution time to
about 15 minutes for a single modern multi-core processor https://github.com/dietmarwo/smart-retry[smart-retry]. 
Inspired by the Messenger optimization model the initial pykep solar orbiter model tried to replicate this success 
avoiding any "bias" regarding resonances and
flight height. Unfortunately this time no algorithm was able to find good solutions. May be we just have
to wait a few years as we did with the Messenger problem?

How much "bias" is required for a solar orbiter optimization model to be "solved" by current state of the art 
optimization algorithms? Candidates for adding bias are:

- Fixed planet sequence
- Fixed flight height over the planets at GA maneuvers - we always take the minimal height to maximize the delta velocity. 
- Only a limited number of fixed resonances are considered. 

Unfortunately with all these limitations we limit the explorative value the optimization model provides. 
But as optimization algorithms evolve we may be able to loosen these constraints later. 

Multiple implementations of this limited model were created: One in Python for pykep which can be configured as 
multi-objective constrained problem to test corresponding optimization algorithms https://github.com/esa/pykep/pull/148[(PR148)]. 
There is a configuration mapping all objective and constraints to a customized weighted sum to test single objective algorithms 
supporting only boxed constraints. To speed up the evaluation of optimization algorithms a Java implementation
was created which only supports the single objective / weighted sum option but was verified to be
equivalent otherwise. So for single objective algorithms the results presented here for the Java implementation 
are valid also for the pykep Python implementation. 
Here https://gist.github.com/dietmarwo/5b6bbadbd696d36806177be2df3c6bb7[solo_mgar_test.py] is example code to test the Python
version and to visualize optimization results listed here: https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/data/solo_results.txt[solo_results.txt]

=== The Experiment

First we compare a few optimization algorithms using parallel retry / unconnected islands. Instead
of the number of function evaluations we limit the overall optimization time to about 5 minutes. This
way algorithms causing less overhead are allowed to perform more evaluations. The number of function evaluations 
per retry was chosen carefully - by trial and error - 
for each algorithm to produce the best possible result at the given time limit. The tested algorithms were

- BiteOpt version 2021.20 https://github.com/avaneev/biteopt/blob/master/biteopt.h[biteopt.h]
- DE1220 from pagmo, default mutation variants {2u ,3u ,7u ,10u ,13u ,14u ,15u ,16u} https://esa.github.io/pagmo2/docs/cpp/algorithms/de1220.html[de1220]
- DE1220 from pagmo, "best/1/exp" mutation variant {1u} https://esa.github.io/pagmo2/docs/cpp/algorithms/de1220.html[de1220] equivalent to 
  https://esa.github.io/pagmo2/docs/cpp/algorithms/sade.html[sade] with "best/1/exp"
- PSO from pagmo, https://esa.github.io/pagmo2/docs/cpp/algorithms/pso.html[pso] using default parameters
- GACO from pagmo,  https://esa.github.io/pagmo2/docs/cpp/algorithms/gaco.html[gaco] using default parameters
- GCL-DE  https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/_fcmaescpp/gcldeoptimizer.cpp[gcldeoptimizer.cpp] - https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106451[DOI]  
- fcmaes-DE variant https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/_fcmaescpp/deoptimizer.cpp[deoptimizer.cpp]
- CMA-ES (fcmaes-C++-implementation) https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/_fcmaescpp/acmaesoptimizer.cpp[acmaesoptimizer.cpp]
- A sequence fcmaes-DE -> CMA-ES (the fcmaes default algorithm). The best member of the resulting DE population is used as guess initializing CMA-ES.

As a first test we check mean, standard deviation and best function value from all retries performed in 5 minutes
for the best resonance sequence:

|GACO |1090971 |966984 |10602 
|CMA-ES |2274047 |2113445 |8121 
|=========================================================

The mean result value gives no indication how "reliably" we find a 
good best value. This experiment is not sufficient to evaluate and compare the tested algorithms. But it may explain why 
fcmaes-DE and CMA-ES work well as sequence: Both are very different regarding mean/sdev but quite good 
regarding the best value they find. CMA-ES alone often gets stuck early at local minima which causes the worst mean
result of all algorithms tested. Nevertheless it can be used to improve fcmaes-DE if both algorithms are 
chained together. Parameters for the pagmo algorithms PSO / GACO and DE1220 can probably be improved because we 
have less experience in using them. 

Instead only testing for one resonance sequence we repeat the experiment for all good resonance sequences taken from 
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java/blob/master/src/main/resources/data/solo_results.txt[solo_results.txt]

The experiment was performed as follows: 

At first different algorithms were applied to the problem were all 281 different resonance sequences are permitted. The
optimization can freely choose between these resonances to find an optimal trajectory. In this process the best arguments + value
for each resonance were recorded. 

Next the best resonances were selected and defined as single target resonance resulting in many different optimization
problem variants each optimized separately. From the results the best known value was subtracted, the resulting list of differences
was sorted and plotted. This plot represents how "reliable" and to which extent an optimization algorithm was able to reproduce the
best known result for each of the 100 best resonance sequences. At first we choose a limit of 5 minutes execution time for each sequence
on a AMD 5950x 16 core processor utilizing all 32 available parallel threads. Algorithms with lower overhead can 
execute more function evaluations at the given time limit. As parallelization method both simple parallel retry - 
in pagmo terms: "unconnected islands" - and a smart retry adjusting bounds and the evaluation budget are tested.

=== Results

image::solo_1.png[]

Let us exclude "DE1220 default mutation variants" since it is not competitive here - maybe different parameters could help?

image::solo_2.png[]

PSO and GACO are significantly better, but still not sufficient to meet the high inclination mission goal.
 
image::solo_3.png[]

DE1220 / SADE "best/1/exp" and CMA-ES are quite similar here. Remember how different their "mean result" values listed in the table above 
are? CMA has a much greater standard deviation / diversity enabling it to catch up if we ask for the best result out of many
retries. But only BiteOpt and the DE-CMA sequence are able to really find good results, BiteOpt more reliably than DE->CMA. 
The smart retry is not competitive using the 5 min time limit for both algorithms. But what happens if we increase the 
limit to 25 minutes? How well do the algorithms scale? Now we only check for the 60 best resonance sequences since these test require much
more time. 

image::solo_4.png[]

With 25 minutes limit the picture changes significantly: Now the smart retry takes over the lead. It scales better than the simple parallel retry (unconnected islands). 

image::solo_5.png[]

Zooming in on the best we see that both DE->CMA and BiteOpt improve now using the smart retry where DE->CMA has a better chance
to "solve" the optimization problem where BiteOpt delivers more consistent results.
