= fcmaes-java - a Java gradient-free optimization library

image::logo.gif[]

fcmaes started as a fast CMA-ES implementation combined with a new smart parallel retry mechanism aimed to solve hard optimization problems from the space flight planning domain. It evolved to a general library of state-of-the-art gradient free optimization algorithms applicable to all kind of real world problems covering multi-objective and constrained problems. Its algorithms are implemented both in C++ and support parallel fitness function evaluation.
fcmaes-java provides the same functionality as its Python variant https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es[fcmaes].
See https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java/blob/master/tutorials/Performance.adoc[Performance] for detailed performance figures. 
It was used by the team Jena & Wuhan for the 
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java/blob/master/img/CTOC11problemdescription.pdf[11th China Trajectory Optimization Competition]
see https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java/blob/master/tutorials/CTOC11.adoc[fcmaes for CTOC11]. A comparison of optimization
algorithms for the solar orbiter mission optimization problem is shown here: https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java/blob/master/tutorials/Solo.adoc[Solar Orbiter].
Cluster support is implemented based on the https://docs.temporal.io/docs/get-started/[Temporal] orchestration engine. 
See https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java/blob/master/temporal/README.adoc[Temporal-readme] 
and https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java/blob/master/temporal/Tutorial.adoc[Temporal-tutorial] 

=== Features

- fcmaes is focused on optimization problems hard to solve utilizing modern many-core CPUs.
- Parallel fitness function evaluation and different parallel retry mechanisms. 
- Minimized algorithm overhead - relative to the objective function evaluation time - even for high dimensions. 
- New multi-objective/constrained optimization algorithm combining features from Differential evolution and NSGA-II supporting parallel function evaluation. Features https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/tjpnsec/11/2/11_18/_article/-char/en/[enhanced multiple constraint ranking] improving its performance in handling constraints for engineering design optimization.
- BiteOpt algorithm from Aleksey Vaneev.
- New DE (differential evolution) variant optimized for usage with parallel retry.
- GCL-DE (differential evolution) variant from Mingcheng Zuo.
- Fast C++ implementations of CMA-ES
- Supports Linux and Windows
- Supports multi node / cluster execution based on https://docs.temporal.io/docs/get-started/[Temporal]

=== DLL dependencies

On windows there may be an issue with recursive dll dependencies preventing loading of fcmaeslib.dll.
It is compiled using mingw64, so if you neither have mingw64 nor Anaconda installed you should add
"/YOUR_PATH_TO/fcmaes-java/src/main/resources/natives/" to the "PATH" environment variable.
 
=== Compilation
 
* `mvn install`

=== Usage

See the https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java/blob/master/src/main/java/fcmaes/examples[examples] and 
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java/blob/master/src/test/java/fcmaes/core/OptimizerTest.java[tests] .
