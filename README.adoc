= fcmaes-java - a Java gradient-free optimization library

fcmaes-java provides fast {cpp}/Eigen based implementations of its gradient free optimization algorithms.
It supports parallel optimization and parallel function evaluation. A new coordinated parallel retry mechanism 
can be viewed as a meta algorithm operating on a population of user defined optimization runs. 
fcmaes-java provides the same functionality as its Python variant https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es[fcmaes].
It was used by the team Jena & Wuhan for the 
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java/blob/master/img/CTOC11problemdescription.pdf[11th China Trajectory Optimization Competition]
see https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java/blob/master/CTOC11.adoc[fcmaes for CTOC11].

=== Features

- fcmaes-java is focused on optimization problems hard to solve.
- Minimized algorithm overhead - relative to the objective function evaluation time - even for high dimensions. 
- Parallel coordinated retry of sequences and random choices of optimization algorithms. 
- Parallel function evaluation.
- New DE (differential evolution) variant optimized for usage with parallel coordinated retry.
- Ask / Tell interface for CMA-ES and DE. 
- GCL-DE (differential evolution) variant from Mingcheng Zuo.
- Fast C++ implementations of CMA-ES, differential evolution, dual annealing and the Harris hawks algorithm.
- Supports Linux and Windows

=== Optimization Challenge

fcmaes-java provides very fast parallel
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java/blob/master/src/main/java/fcmaes/examples[example solvers] for the 
real world space flight design problems https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/gtop[GTOP] and for 
the https://mintoc.de/index.php/F-8_aircraft[F-8_aircraft] problem based on differential equations. 
In http://www.midaco-solver.com/index.php/about/benchmarks/gtopx[GTOPX] you can find implementations 
of the corresponding objective functions using different programming languages.

The challenge is now to solve these problems on a modern 16+ core CPU faster than the  
given https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java/blob/master/src/main/java/fcmaes/examples[examples].
A problem is considered "solved" if you find a solution not worse more than 0.5% compared to the
best solution known. If an optimizer needs multiple retries, take the average amount of time
for all retries until the problem is solved. You may use any tool / programming language. The
solution times given in the tables below are for Linux / AMD 5950x CPU. Windows is slightly
slower, an AMD 3950x CPU is about 10-15% slower.

Note that 'stopVal' is the value determining success and

to reproduce these results - you have to evaluate the logs. The same optimization algorithm
was applied for all problems, using the same parameters both for the optimization algorithm and the coordinated retry.

=== ESAs Messenger-Full Space Trajectory Design Problem

Because of its famous complexity ESAs 26-dimensional https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/gtop/messenger_full/[Messenger full] 
problem is often referenced in the literature, see for instance http://www.midaco-solver.com/data/pub/PDPTA20_Messenger.pdf[MXHCP paper].
fcmaes is the only library capable of solving it using a single CPU - in about 2000 seconds on average using an AMD 5950x.
The Problem models a multi-gravity assist interplanetary space mission from Earth to Mercury. In 2009 the first good solution (6.9 km/s)
was submitted. It took more than five years to reach 1.959 km/s and three more years until 2017 to find the optimum 1.958 km/s. 
The picture below shows the progress of the whole science community since 2009:

102 runs of the coordinated parallel retry were performed on a single AMD 5950x CPU 
using the DE->CMA sequence as optimization algorithm: 

image::DE-CMA_AMD_5950x.png[]

60 of the 102 runs reached a good result below 2 km/s:

image::DE-CMA_AMD_5950x.2.png[]  

About 1.7*10^6 function evaluations per second were performed which shows excellent scaling of the algorithm utilizing all
16 cores / 32 threads.
